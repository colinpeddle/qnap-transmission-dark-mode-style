# qnap-transmission-dark-mode-style

A darkmode css for the bittorrent client Transmission for QNAP

I got tired of being blinded at night by the very bright and white Transmission style. 

Not sure if this will be handy for anyone else, but here it is. 

To install on QNAP, ssh/sftp to /share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/.qpkg/QTransmission3/share/transmission/web/style/

Duplicate the "transmission" folder contained within /style for backup. 

Place the progress.png file from the images/ folder here into style/transmission/images/, overwrite existing.

Place the common.css file into the style/transmission/ folder, overwriting. 

Reload your QNAP>Transmission interface and enjoy the eye relief!
